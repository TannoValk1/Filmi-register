        <p>The story is set after a drug deal gone wrong, when a bruised<br>
           detective must fight his way through a criminal underworld to <br>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlLsFEDHtWs">Exterritorial</a><br>
        <p>When Special Forces soldier Sara visits the US consulate in Frankfurt<br>
           with her young son, he suddenly disappears. Not only that, but no one <br>
           seems to remember ever entering the building. Sara is asked to leave <br>
           the consulate. But she knows that the German authorities have no access <br>
           to the consulate. If she leaves now, she may never be allowed on the premises <br>
           again. In the desperate search for her child, Sara goes into hiding in the <br>
           labyrinth of the consulate, without suspecting that the noose of a dangerous <br>
           intrigue is tightening around her neck.</p><br>

        <p>A tense phone call came into the Shinkansen General Operation Control Center. <br>
           The caller claims that a bomb has been planted on the Hayabusa No. 60 bound for <br>
           Tokyo, and that the bomb will explode as soon as the speed of the Shinkansen train <br>
           drops below 100 km/h. The caller demands 100 billion yen in ransom money to disarm <br>
           the bomb. The last-minute battle unfolds as the crew, passengers, and railroad workers <br>
           strive to prevent the explosion within the limited time available. Will the running <br>
           Hayabusa No. 60 be able to overcome this crisis?</p><br>
